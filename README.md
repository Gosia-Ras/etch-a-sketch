# Etch-a-sketch

## Description

Etch-a-sketch pad that allows to draw using predefined colors as well as randomly generated ones. User can also generate a new pad and define the size.
For this project I used only HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

This is a project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) Foundations course. </br></br>
